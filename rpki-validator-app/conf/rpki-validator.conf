# You can edit this file to override default settings of the rpki
# validator. E.g. to change location resources on disk, or use a
# different port for the http interface.
# 
# By default the start script will expect this file here:
#    conf/rpki-validator.conf
#
# You can override the location of this config script using -c:
#  ./rpki-validator.sh start -c /paht/to/my.config
#

# To override defaults change and uncomment any of the lines below

# Use the following to change JVM parameters

# Change the minimum and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Note:
# - 1GB of memory is needed for the current RPKI repository size
# - But you may want to raise this value if you out of memory errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#        garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
#
jvm.memory.initial=1024m      # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.memory.maximum=1024m      # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm

#
# Proxy settings, used by the JVM, when fetching the RIS BGP dumps and notifications
# about new validator releases. This may help in firewalled environments.
#
# Note:
# - rsync is used as an external program and will not use this proxy
# - you should only specify one type of proxy, if you specify both 'socks' is preferred
jvm.proxy.socks.host=         # leave empty if you don't use a socks proxy
jvm.proxy.socks.port=         # leave empty if you don't use a socks proxy

jvm.proxy.http.host=          # leave empty if you don't use a http proxy
jvm.proxy.http.port=          # leave empty if you don't use a http proxy
